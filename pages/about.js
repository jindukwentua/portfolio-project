              I have always been fascinated with data, what you can do with it,
              and learn from it. Taking those learnings and applying them in
              practical ways to solve problems is something that has just come
              naturally to me. My 4+ years of data analysis, research, and data
              visualization experience along with my background and degree in
              Industrial Mathematics and immense passion for helping people have
              fueled my success so far. I look forward to continuing learning
              and growing, utilizing my analytical, problem-solving, and
              leadership skills in forward-thinking ways to help move the world
              forward.

              I am have been a data scientist for 4+ years. The technologies I
              work with are Python, SQL, R, Excel, Tableau and Javascript. I use
              code, queries and visualizations not only to do my day-to-day job, but also
              to solve everyday problems I come across.
